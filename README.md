# explore-pointblank
Sample project to explore pointblank python package for data validation.

This project demonstrates the use of Pointblank for Pytohn - a powerful library for data validation, testing and documenting data quality.
As a learning exercise, I applied data validation checks to a sample dataset from the FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System), focusing specifically on the Drugs file.
The goal is to understand how to implement column-level validation rules, build a validation report, and ensure the integrity of real-world data using Python.

Example of checks applied:
regex, range checks, null checks, and schema matching etc.

Output: Generate and export a validation report(HTML/CSV)

Dataset Used: Drugs (FARS)
